idea and approach - we compare the adjacent elements with each other and store the bigger element in a variable temp so in this way we compare the temp with the next number 
                    and the bigger of two gets updated or remains in temp   (between two numbers x and y , x is bigger and the third number z 
                     is bigger than x then z is automtatically bigger than x)       and this goes till the last element and finally the final temp is returned.
                      


code -

#include <bits/stdc++.h> 
int largestElement(vector<int> &arr, int n) {
    // Write your code here.
    int temp=arr[0];
   
    for(int i=1;i<=n-1;i++)
    { 
        
        if(temp>arr[i])
        {
            continue;
        }
          else 
          temp=arr[i];
    }
    return temp;
}

time complexity -O(N) since the loop is run for n times .(n is no: of elements in the array)
