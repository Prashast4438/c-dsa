idea->     a number n has factors from 1 to n and factors would be those that leave the remainder 0 on dividing n like 6 has 2 as a factor meaning 6%2=0

approach -> 
             since we have to find the sum of the factors of the numbers from 1 to n we have to make two loops such that first loop is for including all the numbers from 1 to n 
and the second loop is for finding the factors for each number in the loop and since for each no: the factors would be in the range from 1 to that no: and so
the loop conditions start from j=1 to j<=i and so we find find factors by i%j and if they are a factor we use them to find as sum=sum +j;

code->
 
 int sumOfAllDivisors(int n)
{
	// Write your code here.
	int i;
	//int divisors =0;
    int	 rem=0 ,sum=0;
	for(i=1;i<=n;i++)
	{
		
			for(int j=1;j<=i;j++)
			{
			int rem=i%j;
			
             if (rem == 0) 
						{
                     
						 sum=sum+j;
                        }

                }
        }
		return sum;
}
